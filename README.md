# Aspire-project
This is a simple page which is only made using HTML and CSS

The main goal is to make a simple responsive burger image responsive to all screen sizes
The main goal is achived using media queries 
the burger image was cut into multiple images using photoshop where each image has the same height and width
I did this so I can add up some simple liner animation to each image so the burger would look like its closing and opening

and here is a URL where I managed to view it in its own domain: https://aspire-assignment.glitch.me/
